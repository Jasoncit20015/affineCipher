# affineCipher
This program uses the Affine Cipher method for encryption and decryption, where each letter in the plaintext is transformed using the formula y = (a * x + b) % m (where x is the position of the letter in the alphabet, y is the encrypted letter, a and b are the key values, and m is the number of letters in the alphabet, which is 26 for the English alphabet
